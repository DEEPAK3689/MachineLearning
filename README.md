## Problem Statement: 
   Determine the housing prices of properties for new sellers and also      for buyers to estimate the profitability of the deal
    how much is my house worth?

## Scope of project:
    involves looking at recent sales in the neighborhoods.
    Analyze the data, and predict future sales.
		The new seller can sell when the price raises.
		Buyers can purchase the home by analyzing the price when it gets reduced.
## Model selection:
    Linear Regression – 0.7708279745988829
    Logistics Regression – 0.061986301369863014
    RandomForest Regression – 1.0
    Since Linear R model captures the pattern in better way compared to other models , we switch to Linear Regression Model. (for our machine better understanding w.r.t      the Dataset provided).
## Dataset Details
    My dataset is retrieved from Kaggle.
    It contains house sale prices based on its features for homes sold in a certain area.
    My training data set consists of 10 of 81 columns includes houses with 79 features describing every aspect of the house.
    The test data set consists of 10 of 80 columns with the 78 features as every aspect of the house . 
    My test data set excludes the sale price because this is what we are trying to predict.
    Unrequired festures(columns) are removed in preprocessing to perform prediction.
